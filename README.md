# Neural-Network-Image-Processing

This Python code uses TensorFlow to implement the DeepDream algorithm, which visually enhances images by overemphasizing the features learned by a neural network. It starts by downloading and extracting a pre-trained InceptionV3 model, which is known for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks. The model, loaded without its final classification layer, is used to interpret an input image and reinforce patterns it recognizes through gradient ascent. The script's deepdream function iterates over the image multiple times, each time calculating the gradients of the model's activations with respect to the image and updating the image towards those gradients, magnifying the features the model sees. The image is preprocessed to match the input requirements of the model, and after processing, it is rescaled to standard image pixel values and displayed. The process transforms the original image into a dream-like version with amplified textures and patterns, creating a surreal, artistic effect. The script concludes by executing the main function, which orchestrates the DeepDream process and visualizes the output.
