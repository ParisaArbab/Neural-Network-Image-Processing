# Neural-Network-Image-Processing


This script runs DeepDream using TensorFlow 2.x, leveraging a pre-trained InceptionV3 model for feature amplification via gradient ascent to iteratively enhance and visualize patterns in an input image. The model is obtained and prepared for inference, the input is processed and batched, and post-DeepDream, the output is rescaled and plotted. It demonstrates end-to-end implementation from model acquisition to final visualization.
